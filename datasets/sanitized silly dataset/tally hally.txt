Early Years
Tally Hall Logo
Andrew Horowitz, the only member not originally from Michigan, began writing songs
when he was eight years old and eventually headed to the University of Michigan to study
composition. There he met Rob Cantor and Zubin Sedghi, who both attended the same
high school and played in a band called listedBlack. The three would form a band (name
unknown) in December of 2002,[1]
 and first played small shows around the University of
Michigan dorms, where all 5 current members went to school. Their first performance was
at a Basement Arts Showcase in the Arena Theater of The Frieze Building, in Ann Arbor, MI,

Mr. F: Ross' DJ mash-ups
which took place on December 7, 2002.[2]
 The gig was only able to happen because they
could supply the PA system.[3]
Rob met Joe Hawley on campus and as they began to become friendly, Rob learned of Joe's
musical abilities and asked him and Steve Gallagher to join the band as lead guitarist and
drummer respectively. Originally, they played a few gigs under the name Gallagher and
then as 540, the address of their house at the time. By February 2003 however, the band
name would be finalized as Tally Hall, a suggestion by Joe inspired by an indoor shopping
plaza/food court on Orchard Lake Road in Farmington Hills, Michigan. It was developed by
Mel Rosenhaus (1925-2011) and, according to Mr. Rosenhaus' eulogy, was the first food
court in Michigan. It housed a wonderous arcade/museum of coin-op machines and
oddities called Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum, a popular establishment within
Tally Hall and now all that remains after the Tally Hall complex was torn down.
After a couple gigs and some rehearsals in the basement of their college home, they began
to record some demos in Joe's bedroom/attic in April 2003. An early mascot of theirs was a
chinchilla, based on a pet they had. It featured as the cursor on their site and on a couple shirts. Their first EP was titled Party
Boobytrap and included 4 tracks.[4]
On November 9th 2003, Tally Hall would order their now iconic colored ties, first worn in combination with their white dress shirts
around November 2003. They would choose these uniforms to distinguish them from other college bands, and to show their overall
unity as people and as musicians.[5]
On May 14th 2004, they released their second EP, the Welcome to Tally Hall EP. This EP was sold at some of their concerts during
2004, in addition to Party Boobytrap. The band would have one of their first big breaks in the form of an appearance on WJR's Mitch
Albom's radio show, performing Good Day.
[4]
Good Day would also win first place in the 2004 John Lennon Scholarship Competition.[4]
 Andrew met Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys,
Yoko Ono, and was awarded $10,000.[6]
After a concert at the Pingry School in New Jersey, Steve Gallagher left the band[4]
 due to commitment issues. They eventually
recruited drummer Ross Federman.
[4]
 Federman went to high school with Joe and he remembered Ross being a drummer. 2004 also
saw the release of Complete Demos in November, a compilation of the EPs they did over the past two years with an additional track,
Banana Man.
[4]
 This release would be sold at concerts and was available for purchase on tallyhall.com for about a year. The album was
then considered out of print and hard to find until December 2015 when they uploaded it and made it available to purchase through
Bandcamp.[7]
Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum
2005
The band began touring outside their general hometown area in 2005, and would sign under the Quack! Media label to professionally
record Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum, an album titled after the museum of the same name. Joe stated they needed to
partner with a label to progress as a band together and Al McWilliams happened to accept their request of a record deal.[8]
 During
this time they would also release The Pingry EP, which was released at their Pingry School Spring Fling concert in May of 2005.
The band would take 4 months to record and mix Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum, teasing tracks from the album on music
streaming websites like MySpace and keeping fans updated on their website. Tracks from it would be released on a radio promotional
EP to hype fans up for the release in November of 2005. On November 22nd 2005, Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum was
finally released for fans to enjoy. Copies would be sold online and at concerts.
2006
2006 saw the start of their Residency Tour in April,[9]
 in addition to being the opening act for Japanese pop duo Puffy AmiYumi.[10][11]
Alexandra Patsavas, the music coordinator for the television drama "The O.C.", would find a copy of Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical
Museum and liked it so much she would contact Tally Hall about featuring their music on the show.[12]
 The band agreed, and so their
music would be featured on the television series. This was one of the first times Tally Hall would break into more popular culture. "The
Day After Tomorrow" featured Good Day,[13][11]
 and "The Dream Lover" featured Hidden in the Sand.[14]
 Their use on The O.C. would
lead to their recording of The Killers' song Smile Like You Mean It for a compilation CD of artists featured on The O.C. covering other
O.C. artists.[15]
MTV's "The Real World: Key West" featured Banana Man in three episodes as the theme song for John Devenanzio's character "Johnny
Bananas".[11]
New songs Misery Fell, Turn the Lights Off, and a retooling of All of My Friends titled I'm Gonna Win would be played at concerts this
year. Most of these would see release on Tally Hall's second album. Fan favorites At Least a Day and Time Machine were also played at
shows early in the year,[16]
 but were likely never considered for a second album.
Some of these songs were played at their two double header shows at The Blind Pig on April 8th 2006, both of which sold out.[12]
These shows would debut the brief show opener known as "The Kazoo Song".
Radio host Matthew "Mancow" Muller recommended Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum to late night host Craig Ferguson,[17]
which would spark Ferguson to invite the band onto the show to perform. Later on August 2nd 2006, The Late, Late Show aired Tally
Hall's performance of "Good Day".[18]
August 15th saw the re-release of Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum with more focused marketing behind it and a wider
distribution plan. Due to this big marketing push, the band experienced much more success than before, being distributed into more
stores and gaining national attention. Part of this was Tally Hall's appearance in MTV's segment "You Hear It First",[19]
 which was aired
many times on MTV.
2008
After signing to Atlantic Records, the band released Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum for the 3rd time on April 1, 2008[20]
 with
their new record label, but this time they were given the opportunity to re-record and re-mix parts they've never been quite satisfied
with and allow a more experienced engineer to gear the songs in a radio-friendlier manner, though the songs did not gain much more
radio airplay. This re-mixed and re-recorded version was released on April 1st 2008, with Good Day and Welcome to Tally Hall as
promotional singles.
A studio version of Just a Friend was recorded in 2006, and shelved due to the band's dissatisfaction with it, but was later was partially
re-recorded and released as one of a few bonus songs provided by Atlantic Records for the re-release via download code.
In addition to the album, Atlantic Records funded Tally Hall's Internet Show, a ten episode mini-series combining music and skit
comedy. It was intended to coincide with the release of the album but due to some musical licensing issues, there was a delay and the
Internet Show didn't get started until September 2008. Each episode would premiere on the then-newly revamped tallyhall.com, in
addition to some clips posted to their YouTube account.
The band also appeared at a few South by Southwest Music Festivals[21][22]
 and on August 3, 2008, Tally Hall was a performer on the
BMI stage at Lollapalooza.[23]
Tally Hall was invited back by The Late, Late Show with Craig Ferguson on September 16, 2008 to help promote the launch of Tally
Hall's Internet Show.[24]
 They performed a shortened version of "Welcome to Tally Hall" in newly donned black vests over top of their
traditional colored ties, white shirts, and black pants. This was the first time their vests were worn.
Good & Evil
After the completion of M.M.M.M.'s re-release in 2008, many would question when Tally Hall would head into the studio to create a
second album. In May of 2009, they would confirm via Twitter that they were waiting to record a second album in the summer.[25]
These plans would be delayed to fall of 2009, but the band kept busy with touring and eventually a new song. Tally Hall were asked to
write and record a song for a book called "The Magician's Elephant", which they would agree to. On August 12th 2009 they would
start to record the track which would be released in the fall as a free download.[26]
 That track was Light & Night, featuring female artist
Nellie McKay on co-lead vocals.
After the book's release in September, Tally Hall would finally head into the studio to start recording what would become Good & Evil
on October 26th 2009. After completing Good & Evil, the band would spend less than 2 days to rehearse for a tour with Rooney and
Crash Kings.
In March of 2010, Good & Evil finally finished production. After production wrapped, Tally Hall went on a tour with Skybox and Crash
Kings for the remainder of March. This tour would be met with much confusion, as Casey Shea would fill in for Joe Hawley for every
tour date, as well as later dates in 2010. Joe later stated he was unable to tour because his "personal life and my professional life
intersected in a way that may have been considered unsavory." Despite this, the band continued writing new work, some of it later
released in solo efforts by the individual members.
Their 2010 tour would see public performances of other songs from Good & Evil, like Who You Are, You, and Cannibal. The song "Life
in a Cube" by Casey was also performed live with Casey on lead vocals.
Sometime in 2010, Tally Hall would also pitch a series of cover songs to Atlantic Records, a way to cross promote them and other
Atlantic Records artists. The label would have no interest in the project. Only one song from this series was ever released, a cover of
Club Can't Handle Me by Flo Rida with vocals from Casey Shea. Another unsuccessful pitch was the song Strangers, a possible single.
In 2011, the band was released from Atlantic Records and went back to Quack! Media to release their 2nd full-length album, Good &
Evil. Good & Evil was released on June 21, 2011.[27]
On July 20th, Tally Hall would livestream a rehearsal through the website StageIt, in an attempt to raise funds to tour in support of
Good & Evil. It can be assumed this livestream was successful, as they started the Good & Evil tour the next day with SPEAK and Casey
Shea as opening acts.
The last show of the tour was at Mr. Small's Theater on August 20th 2011. This show would be (as of September 2025) the last time
Tally Hall would perform together under this name.
Post-Good & Evil
Tally Hall went on hiatus in fall 2011 after the Good & Evil tour, but the band members have worked on other personal and musical
endeavors.
In March of 2012, Andrew Horowitz released sketches under the name edu. This album would be released only as a cassette tape until
December of the same year, where it was released digitally. The album features Rob Cantor on HEY YOU!. Rob would also launch his
website, robcantor.com, in the same year. The site contained demos and other work, like Cuckoo, Country Good and some
miscellaneous commercial work.
On December 12th 2012, Joe Hawley, Ross Federman, and Bora Karaca released Hawaii: Part II under the name ミラクルミュージカル
(Miracle Musical). This album features contributions from Zubin Sedghi and Rob Cantor, as well as Tally Hall songs that were never
recorded by them.
In 2014, Rob Cantor released his solo album Not A Trampoline, and the now-famous Shia LaBeouf Live single and music video, which
members of Rob's Street Team helped to promote. Shia LaBeouf Live has since become a famous internet meme, and its music video
features Shia LaBeouf himself at the end.
In 2016, Joe Hawley would start a PledgeMusic project for funding a solo album. This would be released as Joe Hawley Joe Hawley in
the same year.
On May 30, 2019, Andrew Horowitz would start a Kickstarter to produce vinyl and CDs of his album sketches. However, sketches
would be remixed, remastered, and retitled to sketches 3d. On June 30, 2019, he hit his Kickstarter goal.[28]
 On July 26, 2019 Andrew
released sketches 3d digitally and would start to ship out backers physical copies. CDs and vinyl would later be listed on Andrew's
store as he had some left over.
Later in August 2019, the band would release their studio cover of Just a Friend on most streaming platforms.[29]
 This decision was
met with much fanfare from fans, and currently is the only single by Tally Hall on streaming services.
Needlejuice Represses
In December 2020, Tally Hall signed with Needlejuice Records, who announced open pre-orders for a reissue of Marvin's Marvelous
Mechanical Museum in early 2021. Once the pre-orders were open the needlejuicerecords.com website crashed due to high demand.
An EP combining Just a Friend and some bonus tracks was announced, and released alongside the reissue. Needlejuice Records had
confirmed that they would also reissue Good & Evil.
On April 1st 2022, Tally Hall's Twitter account would announce a new merch store and re-issue of the "Shirt Shirt" design. This was met
with much praise from the Tally Hall fanbase, and marked the first time that official Tally Hall merchandise had been made available
since 2017.[30]
Good & Evil is currently being reissued by Needlejuice, on CD, Cassette tape, MiniDisc, and Vinyl. The Vinyl will be acommpanied by a
7" single of Turn the Lights Off / Light & Night, marking the first time that Light & Night was made available outside of it's initial
promotional release.
Plans were made in 2013 to record a third album, but minor issues (including either not being ready or being too ready for it) would
derail the project.[31]
Joe Hawley stated in a 2018 radio interview that they have a lot of plans and themes in mind for their 3rd album, and that they never
reached the sound they were trying to achieving for in their previous work. The only problem was that its a "complicated situation"
and a more "administrative or logistic concern".[31]
On December 13th, 2018, as part of ミラクルミュージカル's Reddit AMA, when asked whether Tally Hall is still around, Ross answered:
"Tally Hall still exists. Touring isn't possible at this very moment. That's about the only update".[32]
In an August 15th 2023 Twitter thread, Andrew Horowitz, on behalf of the band, stated that one of the main reasons there hasn't been
a 3rd album or tour is because of Joe Hawley's battle with an unnamed mental illness, which he had been dealing with for years.[33]
On the Tally Hall website, there have been two biographies posted; one in 2006[4]
 and one in 2008, the latter of which is written by
friend of the band Bernie J. Michael, who is not fictitious.[34][35]

On Broadjam.com, the band list their likes and dislikes. Among their likes are chinchillas, "good times", Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen,
and music. Their dislikes are "bad times", chinchilla poachers, and Joseph Stalin. It is also mentions that the origins of performing
with coloured ties was inspired (stolen) from "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles".[36]
For some shows that were 18+ or 21+, Tally Hall would offer fans that couldn't go to their shows a special acoustic set before or
after shows.[37]
 Particularly, one set was played after their November 2006 performance at the North Star Bar.[38]
Comedy Central approached Tally Hall to create music for the television show "Important Things with Demetri Martin", but the band
would turn it down.[39]
"Jimmy Neutron" creator Keith Alcorn and "Will & Grace" actor Eric McCormack are both fans of Tally Hall.[40][41]
 Artist Jonathan
Coulton is also a big fan, seeing the band multiple times in concert.[42]
In interviews from 2007 to 2008, Tally Hall would state they had plans for an amusement park.[43][44]
 It is unknown how serious these
plans were, or if they had any plans past the general idea of an amusement park.
Tally Hall formed an LLC to manage their touring, called Bob Jacobs International LLC.[45]
